# Universal Ctags

universal-ctags has the objective of continuing the development from what existed
in the Sourceforge area. Github exuberant-ctags repository was started by Reza
Jelveh and was later moved to the universal-ctags organization.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified space where
people interested in making ctags better can work together.

## Get Involved

you can do to help us:
